# Study Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Study Projects Repository**! 🚀 This repository serves as a collection of various projects I create while learning different software, tools, and frameworks.

## 🏗️ Purpose
This repo is a personal space where I experiment with new technologies, practice coding skills, and document my learning journey. Whether it's **React Native**, **Python**, **Docker**, or any other tool, you'll find my practice projects here.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each project will be stored in its own directory, categorized by technology or framework for easy navigation. Example structure:
```
📦 study-projects
 ┣ 📂 react-native
    ┣ 📂 subscription-tracker
 ┣ 📂 python
```

## 🚀 How to Use
Feel free to explore the different projects! If you're interested in any specific project:
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alphacrash/study-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```sh
